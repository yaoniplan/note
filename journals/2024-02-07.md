- #### Use "cloudflare"
    - Use R2 (Need PayPal and debit card)
        - R2 - Create bucket - Bucket name (e.g. memos)
        - Manage R2 API Tokens - Create API token - Token name (e.g. Memos R2 Token) - Permissions (e.g. Admin Read & Write) - Copy (e.g. Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Endpoints)
        - R2.dev subdomain - Allow Access - allow - Public R2.dev Bucket URL (copy)
    - Use Worker
        - Workers & Pages - Create application - Create Worker (Optional: Change name) - Deploy
        - Configure Worker - Edit Code - Paste the following code - Save and deploy
        - Trigers - Add Custom Domain - Domain (your subdomain, note that your domain name must be in Cloudflare)
    - Use Tunnels
        - Zero Trust - Networks - Create a tunnel - Select your connector (e.g. Cloudflared)
        - Tunnel name (e.g. memos) - Save tunnel - Choose your environment (e.g. Docker)
        - Copy and run command in your server - Subdomain (e.g. memos) - Domain (e.g. yaoniplan.eu.org) - Type (e.g. HTTP) - URL (e.g. localhost:5230)
- ***Notes***
    - Use UUID instead of auto-increment number to make it unique globally (even across servers)
    - Use environment variables to authorize instead of hard-coding sensitive information
    - Use JSON web token (when have multiple users)
        - Can carry data (like `user_id`, `admin=true`) inside it
        - Is self-verifible (you don't need to query database each time)
        - Has expiration time (`exp`), so tokens expire automatically
        - Is signed so it can't be faked without secret key
    - `vim worker.js`
      ```
      addEventListener(
        "fetch",event => {
           let url=new URL(event.request.url);
           url.hostname="server.tail471ed.ts.net"; // Replace it with the website you want to proxy
           url.protocol='https'; // If the protocol is http, please change it to http
           let request=new Request(url,event.request);
           event. respondWith(
             fetch(request)
           )
        }
      )
      ```
