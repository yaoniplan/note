- #### Use "tilda" in DWM
    - `doas vi ~/.config/dwm/config.h`
      ```c
      static const Rule rules[] = {
          /* class      instance    title       tags mask     isfloating   monitor */
          { "Tilda",    NULL,       NULL,       0,            1,           -1 },
      };
      ```
        - `cd ~/.config/dwm/ && doas make clean install` # Compile to make changes effective
    - `tilda -C` # Config
      ```
      # General
      0 # Auto Hide Delay of "Auto Hide"
      Hide when Tilda loses focus

      # Appearance
      50.00 # Percentage of Height
      70.00 # Percentage of Width
      Centered Horizontally # Position
      
      # Keybindings
      <Alt>a # Pull Down Terminal
      ```
        - `vi ~/.config/tilda/config_0` # Another way
- ***Notes***
    - `tilda --command tmux` # Run the tmux command at startup
    - `doas pacman -S tilda` # Install in Arch Linux
    - `Alt-Shift-q` # Quit to make all changes effective
    - Because it can act as a drop-down terminal and scratchpad.
    - It's a little tasteless.
        - We already have st and dmenu.
