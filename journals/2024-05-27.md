          #!/usr/bin/env sh

          # Set variables
          trashDir="/home/yaoniplan/.trash"
          
          # Delete files and directories older than 30 days
          find "$trashDir" -mindepth 1 -mtime +30 -delete
          ```
        - `chmod +x ~/.local/bin/cleanTrash.sh` # Change executable mode
    - `\rm -rf ~/Downloads/trash` # Unalias to delete
