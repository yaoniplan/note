      ```sh
      # Set PATH to execute scripts anywhere if it exists
      if [[ -d "$HOME/.local/bin/" ]]; then
          export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin/"
      fi
      ```
        - Close your terminal, then open your terminal
        - `echo $PATH` # Check it
- #### ***Notes***
    - `-d` # Directory
    - Advantages
        - Execute scripts anywhere
    - `$HOME/.local/bin/` # Replace it with your directory
    - `chmod u+x ~/.local/bin/captureFullScreen2GIF.sh` # Make the command work
        - `u` # User
        - `x` # Execute
    - `captureFullScreen2GIF.sh` # Execute it anywhere, and works in the dmenu too
    - `PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin/` # Add the directory to `$PATH` temporarily

- #### Show line numbers permanently in Vim
    - `vim ~/.vimrc`
      ```
      " Show absolute line numbers
      set number
      ```
- ***Notes***
    - `set relativenumber` # Show relative line numbers
    - `set number relativenumber` # Show absolute and relative line numbers
    - After using it for a while, It can be distracting.
        - Probably because I'm using a small screen.
