- [[Vim]]copy and paste content from one file to another file
  * `vim to_copy_file to_paste_file` # `to_copy_file`: you want to copy `to_paste_file`: you want to paste
  * `:n` # You will edit the next file after you copy. (You can select where you want to copy via enter "`v`", then you can copy via enter "`y`".)
  * `p` # You can paste it via enter "`p`"
