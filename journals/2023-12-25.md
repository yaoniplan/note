- #### Add zero padding to file name
    - `for n in {1..9}; do old="Python3($n).flv"; new="Python3(0$n).flv"; mv "$old" "$new"; done`
- ***Notes***
    - Because sometimes the tenth file doesn't get sorted correctly.
    - Another method
      ```
      for f in *; do mv "$f" "$(echo "$f" | sed -E 's/\(([0-9])\)/\(0\1\)/')"; done
      ```
        - `-E` # Regular expression
        - `\(` # Escape it and match `(` (The same as `\)`)
        - `()` # A capture group
        - `[]` # Character set
        - `0-9` # Match any digit from 0 to 9
        - `\1` # A backreference to the first captured group
